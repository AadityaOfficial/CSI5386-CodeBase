       " \"Know, O dear readers, that the medicine of a disease is to remove the\\troot cause of that disease. Isa (Jesus Christ) -peace be upon him-\\twas once asked: 'What thing is difficult?' He said: 'God's wrath.'\\tProphet Yahya (John the Baptist) -peace be upon him- then asked:\\t'What thing takes near the wrath of God?' He said:'Anger'. Yahya -\\tpeace be upon him- asked him:'What thing grows and increases anger?'\\tIsa -peace be upon him- said:'Pride, prestige, hope for honour and\\thaughtiness'\\tThe causes which cause anger to grow are self-conceit, self-praise,\\tjests and ridicule, argument, treachery, too much greed for too much\\twealth and name and fame. If these evils are united in a person, his\\tconduct becomes bad and he cannot escape anger.\\tSo these things should be removed by their opposites. Self-praise is\\tto be removed by modesty. Pride is to be removed by one's own origin\\tand birth, greed is to be removed by remaining satisfied with\\tnecessary things, and miserliness by charity.\\tThe prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: 'A strong man is not\\the who defeats his adversary by wrestling, but a strong man is he who\\tcontrols himself at the time of anger.'\\tWe are describing below the medicines of anger after one gets angry.\\tThe medicine is a mixture of knowledge and action. The medicine based\\ton knowledge is of six kinds:\\t(1) The first medicine of knowledge is to think over the rewards of\\tappeasing anger, that have come from the verses of the Quran and the\\tsayings of the Prophet (pbuh). Your hope for getting rewards of\\tappeasing anger will restrain you from taking revenge.\\t(2) The second kind of medicine based on knowledge is to fear the\\tpunishment of God and to think that the punishment of God upon me is\\tgreater than my punishment upon him. If I take revenge upon this man\\tfor anger, God will take revenge upon me on the Judgement Day.\\t(3) The third kind of medicine of anger based on knowledge is to take\\tprecaution about punishment of enmity and revenge on himself. You\\tfeel joy in having your enemy in your presence in his sorrows, You\\tyourself are not free from that danger. You will fear that your enemy\\tmight take revenge against you in this world and in the next.\\t(4) Another kind of medicine based on knowledge is to think about the\\tugly face of the angry man, which is just like that of the ferocious\\tbeast. He who appeases anger looks like a sober and learned man.\\t(5) The fifth kind of medicine based on knowledge is to think that the\\tdevil will advise by saying: ' You will be weak if you do not get\\tangry!' Do not listen to him!\\t(6) The sixth reason is to think: ' What reason have I got to get\\tangry? What Allah wishes has occurred!'\\tMedicine based on action\\tWhen you get angry, say: I seek refuge in God from the accursed evil\\t(A'oudhou billaahi min as shaytaan ir rajeem). The prophet (pbuh)\\tordered us to say thus.\\tWhen Ayesha (RA) got angry, he dragged her by the nose and said: ' O\\tdear Ayesha, say: O God, you are the Lord of my prophet Muhammad,\\tforgive my sins and remove the anger from my heart and save me from\\tmisguidance.'\\tIf anger does not go by this means, you will sit down if you are\\tstanding, lie down if you are sitting, and come near to earth, as you\\thave been created of earth. Thus make yourself calm like the earth.\\tThe cause of wrath is heat and its opposite is to lie down on the\\tground and to make the body calm and cool.\\tThe prophet (pbuh) said: Anger is a burning coal. Don't you see your\\teyebrows wide and eyes reddish? So when one of you feels angry, let\\thim sit down if standing, and lie down if sitting.\\tIf still anger does not stop, make ablution with cold water or take a\\tbath, as fire cannot be extinguished without water.\\tThe prophet (pbuh) said : ' When one of you gets angry, let him make\\tablution with water as anger arises out of fire.' In another\\tnarration, he said:' Anger comes from the devil and the devil is made\\tof fire.'\\tHazrat Ali (RA) said:\\tThe prophet did not get angry for any action of the world. When any\\ttrue matter charmed him, nobody knew it and nobody got up to take\\trevenge for his anger. HE GOT ANGRY ONLY FOR TRUTH.\\t\",\n",
